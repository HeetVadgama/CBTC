TASK-1 MASTERMIND GAME 

Two players play the game against each other; let’s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.


TASK-2 CREATING A PAYMENT RECEIPT

Creating payment receipts is a pretty common task, be it an e-commerce website or any local store for that matter.
Here, you have to create our own transaction receipts just by using python. We would be using reportlab to generate the PDFs. Generally, it comes as a built-in package but sometimes it might not be present too. If it’s not present, then simply type the following in your terminal
first we need to download one library call reportlab to implement this task.
This is a software library that lets you directly create documents 
in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Python programming language. 
It also creates charts and data graphics in various bitmap and vector formats as well as PDF.
it also helpfull to add colors,styles,table etc. 


Task-3 Create Voice Recorder Using Python.


How to Work? ...
--> First of all we install all libraries
 
--> The "wavio" library in Python is a convenient tool for reading and writing WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) files. It simplifies working with audio data in the WAV format by providing easy-to-use functions for reading and writing audio files.

---> The "sounddevice" library in Python is a powerful and user-friendly package for playing and recording audio through Python. It provides a simple interface to access audio devices and play back or record audio data in real-time.

---> We Used Scipy as the recorded audio is saved as a WAV file and then converted to a numpy array for processing and the script plots the time-domain representation of the recorded audio.

---> After That we make one function called savefile() which is used to save our voice as wav. Format. In this function we define some frequency rate for sound.
---> And We will run this function. This function will run according to our timer what we set..and voice recording started!!

Outcomes :- The Wav file would be shown on our directory we download it and run it one our media player.
